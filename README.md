# game-of-life

A simple implementation of the Conway's Game of Life on C#. 

It is a zero-player game based on a simple mathematical representation of a cellular evolution. A two-dimensional grid filled with cells live or dead.
It requires a pre-start configuration and no further input from a player. However, the player can seed more cells or kill them along with the generations logic.
